# go-libvterm

Go binding to libvterm

This is my personal fork for use with
[aerc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc). Breaking changes will come
unannounced.

This is hosted on GitHub because of [a bug in
Golang](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32260). Issues and pull requests
here will be ignored, please send patches to the aerc mailing list instead.
